This is a telegram chatbot. It is designed to calculate the possible profit when launching a course at an online school. 

The user enters the price of the product, the budget spent on advertising, the average cost of the client for entering the funnel, the number of stages of the funnel, as well as his Google mail. Then the bot calculates the conversion rate and calculates the approximate profit in google sheet. The user can open the table and compare the values with his own.
